In the world of milkdown, themes are also plugins. We provide a \`themeFactory\` helper for users to create plugins.

> We use [@emotion/css](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@emotion/css) package to define styles.

## Overview

\`\`\`typescript
import { themeFactory } from '@milkdown/core';

const customTheme = themeFactory({
    font: {
        typography: ['Roboto', 'Helvetica', 'Arial'],
        code: ['Monaco', 'Fira Code'],
    },
    size: {
        radius: '2px',
        lineWidth: '1px',
    },
    color: {
        primary: '#ff79c6',
        secondary: '#bd93f9',
        neutral: '#000',
        background: '#fff',
    },
});
